        <h3>Welcome to ECE Team 11 Senior Design Drexel 2012-13</h3>

<p>We have developed an Android application that is able to provide health monitoring for individuals with pre-diabetes. This application utilizes novel data entry techniques to provide the user with a more efficient experience. In diet entry which is the first aspect of the app, voice input and GPS data have been used to decrease the time taken for a user to input food items. Decreasing time in entering data makes it more likely for a user to keep using the application. The second portion of the application, activity monitoring, is able to determine a userâ€™s activity level over a day by simply keeping the smartphone on with the user. The application is able to determine what the user has done during the day by analyzing the data collected from the accelerometer. The application ties these two features together into one unified app, allowing a user to easily track her progress.</p>
